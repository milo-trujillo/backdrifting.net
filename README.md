This is the code that drives the blog at https://backdrifting.net

It does not include any of the site content - just the Ruby, HTML templating, and CSS that keeps everything ticking. It mostly exists so I can keep track of changes I've made, but if someone wants to see an example of a dead-simple Sinatra blog, there's not much to this repo.
